# Privacy Policy of Damp Basket

Your data always belongs to you, and only you. Damp Basket does not collect any personal data.

## How your data is protected and used

- By default, the **Damp Basket** extension neither collects nor sends any private data to the developer of this extension or any third party. All your data is processed and stored locally on your device.

- If you enable the "synchronize options" setting, your options will be sent to servers belonging to the vendor of the browser you are using.

- The **Damp Basket** extension only works on the supported websites identified during installation. **Damp Basket** needs to inject temporary data into the page on the client side in order to allow adding items to the local basket. No remote resources are downloaded from the supported websites.

- The **Damp Basket** extension saves all data locally using the browser's storage in the format below. You have the option to export said data in *JSON* or *CSV* format to use as you see fit:

    >`{"url":"https://www.<website>/p/0400","imageUrl":"https://cdn.<image>.jpg","name":"Large Eggs","description":"15 Large Eggs","price":0.99,"quantity":1}`

- The **Damp Basket** extension updates locally stored data when visiting a page that contains an item in your local basket. A **Tools** page is also provided to manually update all items in your local basket.  This is done by opening product pages in a single tab which triggers the local update. No data is transmitted remotely during this process.  The tab is closed when all items in your local cart is updated.

- The **Damp Basket** extension does not collect or store any personal data locally and does not provide any *Checkout* functionality and as such does not ask for any payment or personal information.
